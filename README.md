# Optical-Instruments-Automation

I have developed a solid-state quantum emitter that works at room temperature, with the goal of tackling the issues of decoherence and the need for low temperatures that current quantum emitters face. I have built the Confocal Microscopy, HBT, Hyperspectral mapping, Optical characterization setup from scractch. Now, my setup is highly optimized and can measure and analyze any solid-state defect, producing 99% pure quantum qubits. During the measurement and analysis, automation between the instruments are highly necessary for repetitive and accurate results.
